Welcome to the weakest link
[]Any of you could win up to $$$
[]However if you want to win the money you will have to work as a team
[] But only one of you will make it to the end as round by round we eliminate the player voted the weakest link
[] lets meet the team

[] Now the rules
[] in each round the aim is to answer enough questions correctly to reach your $$$ target within the time limit
[] There are # of you and the fastest way to reach that target is  to create a chain of # correct asnwers 
[] if you get a question wrong , you break the chain and lose all the money in the chain
[] but if you bank before you answer your money in the chain will be saved however you will start a brand new chain
[] remember at the end of the round only the  money that has been banked can be carried over to the next round
[] the first round lasts 3 minutes

[pun]
#pun

	who was'nt worth the cost of our AJAX calls,
	who should revisit their books,
	who isnt worth your time, eject the idiot,
	one of you has reached the end of their journey,
	who did a lot to graduate on top of their class

========================Restart loop if round!=last roound ===================================
[] so far you have banked $$$$ out of a possible $$ 
[] [$namee] and [$name] only the two of you remain
[] you have 90 seconds
[] whatever you bank in this round will be doubled and added to your total to make up your grand prize money
[] so [$$$ * 2] is at stake in this round 
[] we will start with [$name]
[last round]
[Time's up]
[] you've managed to bank $$ , we will add that to the money banked from the previous rounds
[] A grand total of $$$ will be taken by only one of you
[] the final round will determine which one of you gets the prize

[] [$name] and [$name] you have made it to the final round and a grand total of $$$ is up for grabs
[] but only one you can take it

[]now you will be playing against each other  head to head
[] you will be asked alternating questions as best of 5
[] whoever answers the most questions correctly wins- its as simple as that 
[] if there is a tie we will go for sudden death
 
[][$name] and [$name] for $$$ lets play the weakest link
[head to head]

[$name] you are the strongest link of this game and you go away with $$$
[$other name] you go away with nothing.
