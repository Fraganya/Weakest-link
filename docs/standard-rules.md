## General Rules
The weakest link game has the following standard rules:


* The game must be played by 5-9 players.
* The contestants take turns answering general knowledge questions.
* A correct answers pushes the chain to the next level.
* One wrong answer breaks the chain and loses any money earned within that particular chain
* Before their question is asked (but after their name is called), a contestant can choose to bank the current amount of money earned in any chain to make it safe, after which the chain starts afresh
* When the allotted time for every round ends, any money which is not banked is lost
* If the host is in the middle of asking a question, or has asked a question but the contestant has yet to answer, the question is abandoned
* If the question is completed, the host gives the correct answer whether the contestant is able to answer the question correctly or not.
* The round automatically ends if the team successfully reaches the maximum amount for the round before the allotted time expires, and the next person says "Bank"
* Round 1 starts with 3 minutes on the clock 
* Every round thereafter (except round 8) is reduced by 10 seconds as players are eliminated
* For Round 8, the last or final round, the remaining 2 players only have 90 seconds (1:30) to triple whatever they bank
* The first person to be asked a question in the first round is the player whose name is first alphabetically. 
* Every subsequent round starts with the "strongest link"â€”the player with the most correct answers from the previous round, unless that person has been voted off, in which case the second strongest link answers first. 

## Money Chain

Using the daytime episodes question values;

| Question # | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| 9          | 1000   |
| 8          | 800    |
| 7          | 600    |
| 6          | 450    |
| 5          | 300    |
| 4          | 200    |
| 3          | 100    |
| 2          | 50     |
| 1          | 20     |



## Voting and Elimination

* At the end of every round, contestants must vote one player out of the game
* Until the beginning of the next round, only the television audience knows exactly who the strongest and weakest links are statistically
* While the contestants work as a team when answering questions, they are at this point encouraged to be ruthless with one another
* Players often decide to vote off weaker rivals, but occasionally decide to eliminate stronger players as well, in hope that it then improves their chances of winning the game
* The player with the most votes is given a stern "You are the weakest link. Goodbye!" or "With [#] votes, you are the weakest link. Goodbye!" and must walk off the stage in what is called the "Walk of Shame."
* In the event of a tie or draw, the strongest link has the final decision about who is eliminated

## Final Round

* The last two contestants work together in the eighth and final round identical to the previous ones, however, all money banked at the end of this round is tripled and added to the current money total, forming the final total for the game.
* t the end of this round, there is no elimination, with the game instead moving to the head-to-head round. 


## Head to head round

* The remaining 2 players are each required to answer 5 questions each in a penalty shootout format
* The strongest link from the previous round chooses who goes first.
* Whoever has the most correct answers at the end of the round wins the game.
* In the event of a tie, the game goes to Sudden Death.
* Every player continues to be asked questions as usual, until 1 person answers a question correctly and the other incorrectly




The winner of the game is declared "the strongest link" and takes home all of the money accumulated in the prize pool for the game, and the loser leaves with nothing, like all previous eliminated players
